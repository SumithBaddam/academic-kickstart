I am working as a Data Scientist in Amazon Alexa. I primarily work on enabling/improving Alexa Speech Recognition (ASR) for Shopping domain. I build machine learning models to improve the ASR for single-turn and multi-turn conversations, perform statistical tests (A/B testing) for launch of new features and perform statistical analysis for identifying customer prone errors and implement solutions for improving the customer experience while having conversations with Alexa realted to Shopping domain. Prior to joining Alexa, I previously worked as a Software Development Engineer at Amazon Web Services (AWS) primarily on building end-to-end machine learning applications and pipelines for AWS CloudFormation feature to estimate resource provision time for customers. 

I completed two master's degrees in Data Science from Indiana University Bloomington and IIIT Bangalore. Prior to this, I worked as a Data Scientist at Cisco Systems India for 2.5 years where my key focus was on building large-scale machine learning models to improve the quality of Cisco's products, internal workflows and productivity of engineers. While working at Cisco, I have filed a patent for building a customer centric bug prioritization feature to enable faster resolution for issues faced by customers and have published 2 papers related to predictive modeling using Deep Learning algorithms.

I was also a key note speaker at International Conference of Business Analytics and Intelligence at Indian Institute of Management Bangalore in 2017 and at Indian Institute of Science in 2018.
