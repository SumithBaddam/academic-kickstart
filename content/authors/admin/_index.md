I am a Machine Learning scientist and an enthusiast. I completed two master's degrees in Data Science from Indiana University Bloomington and IIIT Bangalore. 

I worked as an intern at Amazon Web Services during summer of 2020 on building an end-to-end machine learning application for AWS CloudFormation to estimate resource provision time for customers. Prior to that, I worked as a Data Scientist at Cisco Systems for 2.5 years where my key focus was on building large-scale machine learning models to improve the quality of Cisco's products. While working at Cisco, I have filed a patent for building a customer centric bug prioritization feature to enable faster resolution for issues faced by customers and have published 2 papers related to predictive modeling using Deep Learning algorithms.

I was also a key note speaker at International Conference of Business Analytics and Intelligence at Indian Institute of Management Bangalore in 2017 and at Indian Institute of Science in 2018.
