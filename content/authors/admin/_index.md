I am an Applied Scientist at Amazon Ads, where I develop and optimize machine learning models to improve advertising performance and customer experience. My work involves building scalable algorithms for ad relevance, ranking, and targeting, conducting rigorous A/B tests to evaluate new features, and performing statistical analyses to identify patterns and improve system accuracy. Prior to my current role, I worked at Amazon Alexa, focusing on enhancing speech recognition for the AI Shopping Agent through conversational modeling and at Amazon Web Services (AWS), where I developed end-to-end Machine Learning pipelines for Infrastructure as a Code service (CloudFormation) to estimate resource provisioning times. I hold two master’s degrees in Data Science from Indiana University Bloomington and in Information Technology from IIIT Bangalore, and previously spent 2.5 years as a Data Scientist at Cisco Systems India, building large-scale deep learning models to improve product quality, engineer productivity, and customer experience. During my time at Cisco, I published research paper on a customer-centric bug prioritization system with predictive modeling using deep learning. I have also delivered keynote talks at the International Conference of Business Analytics and Intelligence at IIM Bangalore (2017) and at IISc Bangalore (2018).
